== FULL PROJECT NOTES

If we end up working together we will be finishing a responsive website with approximately 7 different views including:
- Landing page
- Order process (~4 screens)
- My account (~4 screens)

All of the views already are available as Illustrator files and exist as HAML files in the Rails app. We just need to polish the styling, custom form elements, etc.

Need to complete ASAP/mid-January.

It will be just you and me working together. No non-technical project managers :)

Email me with any questions parker.holcomb at gmail.com.


== HOW TO FIX CONFIG ERRORS

- When `bundle install` in El Capitan, following error could happen.
    gem eventmachine fatal error: 'openssl/ssl.h' file not found

  Try this:
    gem install eventmachine -- --with-cppflags=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
